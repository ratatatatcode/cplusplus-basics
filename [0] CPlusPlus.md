# C++ Programming Language

**What is C++?**<br>
According to [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/), C++ is a popular programming language used to create computer programs. It is similar to C, but it supports classes and objects.

According to [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/c-plus-plus/), C++ is known for its fast speed and low-level memory management, which means programmers must manually control how a program uses a computer’s memory.

Following the tradition of most programmers, let us begin with "Hello World."

Open your IDE or [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/) and run this code,
```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout<<"Hello World";

    return 0;
}
```
